Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) system implemented using [TensorFlow 2.x](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and trained on the [IIIT DataSet](https://cvit.iiit.ac.in/research/projects/cvit-projects/indic-hw-data). 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV 4.x
- editdistance
- TensorFlow 2.x


## Steps To run the model

run finalmodel.ipynb 

and all the preprocessing is done and saved in files and those files are imported in the finalmodel
